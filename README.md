# BreakTime

## Introduction

People are very busy nowadays because of the demands of their job. It does not matter what job it is, everyone is super focused on what they are doing. We call these people “workaholics” and I am one of them. At the end of the work day, we feel exhausted and just think of going to sleep. While it might help us in our career to stay focused on the job, this kind of routine has its drawbacks in the long run. It is physically and mentally unhealthy if we continue this and refrain from taking care of ourselves.

Taking breaks during a long day’s work is a simple way of taking care of ourselves and this simple act can benefit us in many ways. Due to this, I will make a mobile application to fight the issue of workaholics and remind them to take breaks from time to time. This app will be called **BreakTime**. Its main purpose is to help people be aware and conscious about their health and to take breaks between work hours.
